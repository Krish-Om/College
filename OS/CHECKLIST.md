## 🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Complete Coverage:
1. **Add disk scheduling algorithms** if required by your syllabus
2. **Consider synchronization problems** for advanced understanding
3. **Review your course syllabus** to ensure all required topics are covered

### For Better Presentation:
1. ✅ Use the provided `LAB_REPORT.md` for documentation
2. ✅ Run `./build_all.sh` to compile all programs
3. ✅ Test all programs with different inputs
4. ✅ Include performance analysis in your report

## 🚀 QUICK START

```bash
# Compile all programs
./build_all.sh

# Test a few programs
./Lab1/bin/fcfs
./Lab2/bin/tiny_banker
./lab3/bin/fifo
./lab4/bin/first_fit
```
