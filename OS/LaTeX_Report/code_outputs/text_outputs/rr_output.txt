Round Robin Scheduling (Time Quantum = 2)
Process execution order:
P0 runs from time 0 to 2 (remaining: 3)
P1 runs from time 2 to 4 (remaining: 1)
P2 runs from time 4 to 5 (completed)
P3 runs from time 5 to 7 (remaining: 2)
P0 runs from time 7 to 9 (remaining: 1)
P1 runs from time 9 to 10 (completed)
P3 runs from time 10 to 12 (completed)
P0 runs from time 12 to 13 (completed)

Result:

P	BT	CT	TAT	WT
P0	5	13	13	8
P1	3	10	10	7
P2	1	5	5	4
P3	4	12	12	8
